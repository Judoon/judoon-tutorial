## Quick start: or spreadsheet-to-webpage in 10 seconds

Now we'll walk you through an example of building a **view**.

First, we'll need a sample data set.  We're going to start by turning
[this Excel spreadsheet](data/simpson2008.xls) containing siRNA
migration screen data into a simple, searchable data table.  First, we
login to our Judoon account, which will take us to this page:

Next, we in the click on the 'Upload Dataset' button and select our
spreadsheet.

Click 'Submit', and then you will be taken to a page that looks like
this:

**Presto!** You now have a searchable, sortable data
table!  Try typing in the search bar to see how the displayed rows
automatically get filtered. Click on the up/down arrows next to the
column names to changes the sort order of the data.

postamble on our view.

## Formatting your spreadsheet

One worksheet, worksheet name == dataset name (changable later), first
row is column headers, all following rows are data.

For now, columns are immutable, so trim anything you don't want to
upload.
