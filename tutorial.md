## Quick start: or spreadsheet-to-webpage in 10 seconds

Now we'll walk you through an example of building a **view**.

First, we'll need a sample data set.  We're going to start by turning
[this Excel spreadsheet](data/simpson2008.xls) containing siRNA
migration screen data into a simple, searchable data table.  First, we
login to our Judoon account, which will take us to this page:

![moo](img/quickstart-overview.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/quickstart-overview.png)

Next, we in the click on the 'Upload Dataset' button and select our
spreadsheet.

![moo](img/quickstart-upload.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/quickstart-upload.png)

Click 'Submit', and then you will be taken to a page that looks like
this:

![moo](img/quickstart-view.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/quickstart-view.png)

**Presto!** You now have a searchable, sortable data
table!  Try typing in the search bar to see how the displayed rows
automatically get filtered. Click on the up/down arrows next to the
column names to changes the sort order of the data.

Next, lets look at how to customize the header, preamble, and
postamble on our view.


## Customizing our view

A dynamic table is great, but you probably want to customize it beyond
the boilerplate provided.  Click on the `Edit` tab, and your screen
will look like this:

![moo](img/customizing-edit.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/customizing-edit.png)

To change the **title**, click on the text and a toolbar with formatting
buttons will appear.  Type whatever text you like inside the box.

![moo](img/customizing-title.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/customizing-title.png)

You can highlight portions of the text and use the buttons to set
the inline formatting that you want.  Available options include:
bolding, italics, underlining, strikethroughs, superscripts, and
subscripts.

Next, edit the **preamble**.  Editing the preamble is a lot like
editing the title, but with many more formatting options available to
you.

![moo](img/customizing-preamble.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/customizing-preamble.png)

We'll ignore the column editing for now.  If you'd like to jump ahead,
see [Fancier views](#fancier-views). At the bottom of the page is the
**postamble**, which you can edit just like the preamble.

![moo](img/customizing-postamble.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/customizing-postamble.png)

When you're done editing, click the `Save` button, and you'll be
notified that your changes have been saved.

[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/customizing-click-save.png)

![moo](img/customizing-saved.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/customizing-saved.png)

Click on the `Preview` tab and you can see your new view as it will
appear in all it's awesome glory!

![moo](img/customizing-preview.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/customizing-preview.png)

Now, we'll talk about making our new view publicly available.
    
## Publishing our data

Sharing is what makes the web so wonderful!  Let's allow the world to
see the data we've worked so hard to generate.  Above the **title** is
a button that says `Public` and `Private`.  Click `Public`, then click
the `Save` button.

![moo](img/publishing-button.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/publishing-button.png)

A message will appear to let you know that making your page public
will necessarily make the underlying dataset public.  If this is
acceptable, click `OK`.  If not, you can continue to use Judoon, but
no one else will be able to see your data.

![moo](img/publishing-confirm.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/publishing-confirm.png)

Our dataset has been made public!

![moo](img/publishing-saved.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/publishing-saved.png)

Now logout so we can see what the general public sees.  This will take
us to the frontpage.

![moo](img/publishing-logout.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/publishing-logout.png)
![moo](img/publishing-index.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/publishing-index.png)

In the navigation bar across the top, click on `Browse` &gt; `Public
Views`.

![moo](img/publishing-viewnav.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/publishing-viewnav.png)

This will show us a list of all public views.

![moo](img/publishing-publiclist.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/publishing-publiclist.png)

Click on the view we just created, and you can see how our view
appears to the general public.

![moo](img/publishing-publicview.png)
[(fullsize)](./img/fullsize/publishing-publicview.png)

We have now turned our spreadsheet into a searchable, sortable webpage
that is shared with the world.  That's pretty nifty, but the real
power of the web is in providing links to other related resources.
Which brings us to our next section...

## Formatting your spreadsheet

One worksheet, worksheet name == dataset name (changable later), first
row is column headers, all following rows are data.

For now, columns are immutable, so trim anything you don't want to
upload.
